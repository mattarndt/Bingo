# Bingo
### all of the object oriented, main classes and forms are in the ArndtBingo folder.

This is a single instance of a game of bingo. 
I created this using C# .NET in Visual Studio for my component based software design class


To open and run this program, you must have visual studio installed on your computer (windows only). 
If visual studio is installed, double click the .sln file, this will open up the project.
Run the game by pressing f5.

Enjoy.
